magicTriangleDocumentation = <b>Fast, Good or Cheap - define your strategy and pick two.</b> When solving a problem or working on your goal, you must choose only two out of the three options to define you strategy. You can't have it all. It's a reality of life - you must deal with it.<br/><br/><b>Good + Fast = Expensive</b> ... choose good and fast to postpone every other challenge, cancel all other activities and stay up 25-hours a day just to get your job done. But don''t expect it to be cheap (in terms of resources in general, not just money).<br/><b>Good + Cheap = Slow</b> ... choose good and cheap when you want to do a great job with relatively low investment.  Your strategy is to work on the goal only when you have a free moment from other goals.<br/><b>Fast + Cheap = Inferior</b> ... choose fast and cheap if you don''t plan to pay extra attention to the goal. You are fine an inferior result delivered on time.
